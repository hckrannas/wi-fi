# Basic Terminologies & Concept 
## 1. Access Point (AP)
An Access Point (AP) is a device that creates a wireless local area network (WLAN), typically in an office or large building. It connects to a wired router or switch and allows WiFi-enabled devices to connect to the network.
  * Purpose: To serve as a bridge between wired and wireless networks.
  * Functionality: Broadcasts a WiFi signal, allowing devices to connect to it wirelessly.
## 2. Service Set Identifier (SSID)
The SSID is the name of a WiFi network. It's what you see when you search for available networks on your device.
  * Purpose: Identifies the network.
  * Configuration: Can be set to a unique name by the network administrator.
## 3. Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)
The BSSID is the MAC address (hardware address) of the AP or wireless router. It uniquely identifies each AP on the network.
  * Purpose: Distinguishes between different APs within the same network.
  * Format: Typically in hexadecimal format, e.g., 00:14:22:01:23:45.
## 4. Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID)
The ESSID refers to the SSID used across a group of APs that form an Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS consists of multiple APs with the same SSID, allowing seamless roaming for clients.
  * Purpose: Facilitates roaming and consistent connectivity across multiple APs.
  * Example: Multiple APs in a large office building using the same SSID.
## 5. Roaming
Roaming in WiFi refers to the ability of a device to move between different APs within the same ESS without losing the connection or needing to reconnect manually.
  * Purpose: Maintains network connection while moving.
  * Mechanism: The device automatically switches to the AP with the strongest signal.
## 6. Channel
WiFi channels are specific frequency ranges within the broader WiFi frequency bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) used for communication.
  * Purpose: Allows multiple networks to operate without interfering with each other.
  * Selection: Channels should be set to minimize interference from nearby networks.
## 7. Data Rate 
Data rate refers to the speed at which data is transmitted over the wireless network, typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
  * Purpose: Indicates network performance and bandwidth.
  * Influencing Factors: Signal strength, distance from the AP, network congestion.
## 8. Beacon 
A beacon is a type of frame sent by an AP at regular intervals to announce the presence of the network.
  * Purpose: Helps devices locate and connect to the network.
  * Contents: Includes SSID, supported data rates, and other network information.
